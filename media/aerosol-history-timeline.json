He focussed therefore on stopping chains of transmission. Because he saw most transmission happening at short-range, which he called 'close contact', he suggested it was reasonable to him that this meant diseases were transmitted by droplets. He is wrong about this last part but the rest was brilliant. As an aside, he did not think fomites account for much transmission."
