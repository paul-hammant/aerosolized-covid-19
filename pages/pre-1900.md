Years represented in this timeline: 400 BCE through 1888 CE. What's represented is clear knowledge that many diseases are airborne, and the Covid-19 pandemic strategy of not indicating airborne/aerosol as the predominant transmission route was a major mistake.

The same particle size caveats  for airborne/aerosol vs droplets of the [main historical timeline page]() apply. Obviously the further back in time the reference is the less able the world was to inspect particles, virons and bacteria.
