Two meters horizontally, is the **arbitrary** cut-off distance for transmission that the west has been using during the pandemic. What science is this incorrect **arbitrary** distance did this come from?

## Study: Two metres or one: what is the evidence for physical distancing in COVID-19?

They historical studies they reviewed with conclusions:

* Wells (1955): didn't conclude that 2 meters (or so) was significant, or a cut off for transmission
* Flugge (1897): didn't conclude that 2 meters (or so) was significant, or a cut off for transmission

The US CDC themselves included a discussion [in a September 2013 edition of their 'Emerging Infection Diseases' magazine](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/9/12-0311_article).

Wells confirmed TB was airborne with hamsters in the middle of the last century and struggled to get that accepted. No studies since that used hamsters to see if there was anything special about six feet / two meters in respect of airborne virus infections.
